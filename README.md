This exercise was solved taking into account the following information:

1) 400 orders are created with a random order date between "2015-01-01" and "2022-11-12".

2) Each order can have up to 3 items.

3) Products with creation date between "2018-01-01" and the current date are created.

4) Added the condition that only the user defined interval is allowed to be at least one year.

5) Only the oldest product of each order is being considered.

Example result:
